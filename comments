maybe add something to the readme explaining this is just to demonstrate eventing as you can obviously just directly consume from the bitcoin websocket

where are the docker images available?

I don't think the vendor folder should go in the repo

why is there a yaml folder in the root and sub folders?

are you sure it will always be node port 31234

you still have your username in your urls:
https://knative.dev/josiemundi/transactionClassified


add some example terminal output or screenshots? 



is it possible to test this on a "clean" machine 




for next time :) :
code should prably live in a src folder inside each of the components
can probably keep out "knative-eventing" of all the naming as it is all about knative evening and saves a lot of typing
the reply should probably come from a different serive rather than the web app
web app ui and api should be seperated
